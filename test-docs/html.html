    <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Overview</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. <span class="highlight">Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</span></p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> Computational models inspired by biological neural networks that excel at pattern recognition and complex data analysis.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A machine learning technique that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> The branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Computer vision and image recognition</li>
        <li>Voice assistants and speech recognition</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
        <li>Medical diagnosis and drug discovery</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Future Implications</h2>
    <p>The rapid advancement of AI technologies promises to revolutionize industries ranging from healthcare to finance. However, <em>ethical considerations and responsible AI development remain crucial challenges</em> that require ongoing attention from researchers, policymakers, and society as a whole.</p>
